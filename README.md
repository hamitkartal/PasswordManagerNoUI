Password Manager without UI

This terminal application is for personal use. It is difficult to memorize every password we have for each platform today. For this need, I built an INSECURE simple python application. Program passwords are kept as hash values in the database. However, the stored passwords of the users are kept plain in the database FOR NOW. In future, they will be kept in decrypted form.<br>Another future feature is, users will be able to change their program passwords.
